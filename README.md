# Graph-Based-Searching-Algorithms


1. Perform a comparative analysis on the performance of the Depth First Search (DFS) and Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithms for computing the shortest path between cities of Romania.  |Python|

2. Identified the shortest path between two cities of the US using three different search approaches:
        a) A* algorithm
        b) Djikstra's Algorithm
        c) Greedy Algorithm

Algorithms were coded in basic Python with numpy being the only library used. 
   
Later a comparative study of the three algorithms was done. It was observed that A* performs best in finding the shortest distance and it has an efficient node expansion process in comparison to the Djikstra approaches. 

The Greedy approach does not take into account the path cost between two cities, hence it always finds a path to the destination city with the least number of nodes expanded.
